                <p><strong>Connect Quick book Invoice state with Blockchain</strong>
QuickBooks users can now connect their Invoice Data with InFactor a XinFin Blockchain Platform</p>
<p>Developer Network at XinFin today announced that QuickBooks users can now connect their invoice data directly with InFactor, a blockchain-based invoice factoring platform from XinFin. By connecting their invoice data with InFactor, QuickBooks users (companies/suppliers who want to factor their invoices) can utilize their account receivables (AR) to rapidly access cash without any additional effort of moving invoices from one system to another. </p>
<p>After completing a quick setup on their local machine, QuickBooks users can sync their invoices with InFactor. InFactor is authorized to access the complete user’s invoice data including the details of company, customers, suppliers, employees, and invoice mapping is done automatically for users looking to factor their invoices on InFactor platform. </p>
<p>URL:https://github.com/XinFinOrg/Developer-Resource/blob/master/docs/dapp/infactor.io/quickbook-integration.md
*Please note that it’s a TestNet PoC URL and will go into production once XinFin MainNet gets launched.
“Lack of liquidity is one of the major reasons small businesses struggle. InFactor will help QuickBooks users improve their cash flow by making invoice factoring a piece-of-cake in the first place. InFactor will capture the existing data sets from QuickBooks and map them automatically to fetch new invoices for factoring. While it saves companies the trouble of uploading every single invoice on our platform, it also connects companies with financiers looking to buy the invoices for factoring. This improves liquidity for small businesses”, said Can Inac, Ecosystem  Partner, XinFin. </p>
<p>Smaller segments with poor credit or with no financial track record are turned down by banks due to less risk appetite. InFactor will put the track record of all small businesses (who are QuickBooks users) on blockchain making their invoices accessible to global factors. This gives QuickBooks users access to a larger market for factoring. </p>
<p>InFactor leverages the transparency of blockchain to assign a unique fingerprint to every invoice and automates the whole verification process. Built on the common standard of factoring invoices, InFactor protects users from double invoicing leading to fraud prevention. </p>
<p>Built on XinFin Protocol, InFactor is interoperable with ERP systems, centralized switching &amp; banking systems, and blockchain platforms which makes data sharing easy, secure and instant for factoring. </p>
<p>InFactor is an easy-to-use platform. Small businesses looking to sell their invoices for factoring can sign up here or watch this demo video to know step by step process of registering on InFactor platform. </p>
