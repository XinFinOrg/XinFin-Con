URL:https://github.com/XinFinOrg/Developer-Resource/blob/master/docs/dapp/infactor.io/quickbook-integration.md *Please note that it\u2019s a TestNet PoC URL and will go into production once XinFin MainNet gets launched. \u201cLack of liquidity is one of the major reasons small businesses struggle. InFactor will help QuickBooks users improve their cash flow by making invoice factoring a piece-of-cake in the first place. InFactor will capture the existing data sets from QuickBooks and map them automatically to fetch new invoices for factoring. While it saves companies the trouble of uploading every single invoice on our platform, it also connects companies with financiers looking to buy the invoices for factoring. This improves liquidity for small businesses\u201d, said Can Inac, Ecosystem Partner, XinFin. Smaller segments with poor credit or with no financial track record are turned down by banks due to less risk appetite. InFactor will put the track record of all small businesses (who are QuickBooks users) on blockchain making their invoices accessible to global factors. This gives QuickBooks users access to a larger market for factoring. InFactor leverages the transparency of blockchain to assign a unique fingerprint to every invoice and automates the whole verification process. Built on the common standard of factoring invoices, InFactor protects users from double invoicing leading to fraud prevention. Built on XinFin Protocol, InFactor is interoperable with ERP systems, centralized switching & banking systems, and blockchain platforms which makes data sharing easy, secure and instant for factoring.
